### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, specifically part 2, was one of my favorite projects because I never knew how to play Blackjack but I was always interested. Out of all the projects, this was the one where I felt I understood the functions most, and even when I was confused I was able to understand it after going over it again.

* Lab 7 

    Lab 7, I really liked this lab. I am biased towards it because this was one of the labs where I had the easiest experience with coding the functions. This project also helped a lot with my understanding of strings.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, this was the first lab where I had to use my terminal so I was able to get good experience with Linux. This project also strengthened my knowledge of using double variables, which is why I also like it a lot.
